We see this group as a talented group that’s able to do good things, and we want to use Copa America to show that we’re focused on going as far as we can.\"Most Copas since 1993 have had 12 countries, including two guests - with Japan and Qatar having played in past editions - but the last one in 2021 just had the 10 South American nations.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, USA’s Ricardo Pepi and Mark McKenzie discuss Copa AmericaMessi\\'s final major tournament?It could prove to be a final international tournament for one of football\\'s legends, Argentina forward Lionel Messi, 36.

I don’t know how I will be in that moment.\"Messi is aiming for a third winners\\' medal in a row for his country, after the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup, having never won a senior international tournament until the age of 34. The final will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami - which is just over 20 miles from the city of Fort Lauderdale, where Messi\\'s club currently play.Argentina could become the most decorated Copa America side ever if they win the title again.

Someone who has plenty of experience\\nwinning trophies and making history. \\nJosé Mourinho was appointed Manager and Head Coach of \\nTottenham Hotspur on 20th November 2019, following the \\nsacking of ex-coach Mauricio Pochettinho. In his press conference\\na week later, he was asked, \"Do you think, not winning the final in\\nThe Champions League pay a toll in the squad of Mauricio \\nPochettinho ?\". José replied, \"I don\\'t know, because I\\'ve never lost\\na champions league final.\" This shows José\\'s mentality and that he\\nwas under no pressure. Spurs were 14th when he was appointed. \\nThey ended up finishing 6th in the 2019-2020 season, nabbing a \\nEuropa League spot from Wolverhampton Wanderers only on goal\\ndifference.\\nTottenham Hotspur 2020-2021\\nAfter a very poor start to the season with a 1-0 loss and a sorry \\nshowing against Ancelotti\\'s Everton, José made 3 notable \\nsignings. Matt Doherty from Wolves, Pierre Emile Hojbjerg from \\nSouthampton and Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid. He also \\nconfirmed the loan of Gareth Bale, who has returned to Spurs after\\n7 years at Real Madrid. Sergio Reguilon and Doherty has showed \\ntheir prowess in the left and right back positions respectively, \\nthough I believe they have much more to give.

He seems to be very injury prone as well. \\nJosé Mourinho has kept Tottenham's conventional counter attack \\nplaystyle and combined it with deep defending and quick breaks to\\nmake a very balanced team. Spurs have looked very dangerous in \\ntheir counter attacks this season. The Belgian Toby Alderweireld \\nand midfielder converted defender Eric Dier has proven to become\\nsolid centrebacks, even though they do let up once in a while. As \\nof January 5th 2021, Spurs have only conceded 15 goals ( second \\nto Manchester City who have played a game less ) and of the goals\\nthey have conceded, only 3 were from open play this season. This \\nmeans that 12 goals were from set pieces, penalties or corners. \\nAlmost halfway through the season, that is an unbelievably good \\ndefensive record. But also shows the lack of discipline at the back \\nof the pack.\\nHigher up in the midfield, Tanguy Ndombele has been \\nphenomenal. After a rough start to his Spurs career with a poor \\nrelationship with Mourinho, he seemed to have completely \\nregained the confidence of his manager. He has started 14 out of \\nthe 15 games played by Tottenham in the Premier League this \\nseason so far. He has been fearlessly taking on opponents and \\nbeating them by dribble and skill. He's also played notable and \\ncreative passes, trying to fill a void once left by former Spurs hero,\\nChristian Eriksen. Giovanni Lo Celso, the Argentine, and Moussa \\nSissoko has also been very stong in their attacking and defensive \\nduties. Hojbjerg has turned out to be a rare, strong and dedicated \\ndefensive midfielder. He's had the most number of interceptions \\nand an exquisitely high work rate this season.

Interestingly, his \\naggressive playstyle has lead him to bleed thrice on the pitch this \\nseason, but refusing to come off in any of those games till \\nMourinho forced him to. Harry Winks hasn't quite hit out, but is \\ntrying his best to impress the boss. Rather than possession, the \\nspurs midfield has concentrated on moving up the pitch and \\npressing when possession is lost. Spurs' faliure in scoring one goal\\nand shutting down the game has lead them to become more \\nadventurous, trying to get a second goal before 'Parking the bus'.\\nThere can't be another striker enjoying this season as much as Son \\nHeung Min and Harry Kane has. They have been in the \\npartnership for over 6 years but hasn't shown this level of \\ntelekinetic communication and understanding of each other's play \\nstyles. The duo has scored 13 goals through their partnership in \\nthe Premier league this season, setting up a new record previously \\nheld by Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton in the 1994-95 season. \\nWhat makes this unbelievable is that not even half of the season is\\nover yet! Harry Kane, previously a Target-man striker, has started \\nto play deeper in the midfield. His passing and through balls has \\nbeen excellent. However, he has the tendency to try and win \\nfreekicks for his team in rather very dangerous ways. Son has been\\nthe deadliest of strikers this season. Very pacey and clinical in his \\nmovement. He bagged the Puskas Award 2020 for his goal against \\nBurnley last year, which has massively boosted his confidence. All\\ngood things aside, a major concern for José Mourinho has been \\nthe inconsistency and poor form of his other forwards. Gareth \\nBale and Eric Lamela are injured half of the time.
